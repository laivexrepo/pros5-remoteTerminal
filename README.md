# pros5-remoteTerminal
RPI Zero W serial terminal interface

Test code now includes the ability to write JSON packages, requireas json.hpp to be included in PROSV5 project. See: https://github.com/nlohmann/json for json.hpp and documentation as to it's use.

This code should be used for experimentation only not for production, and relies on the webAccess python code to be present on the RPI Zero W.
